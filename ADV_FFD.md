**Advanced Financial Fraud Detection Model with Dashboard**

Overview
The Advanced Financial Fraud Detection Model with Dashboard is a robust fraud detection system that integrates machine learning techniques with a real-time dashboard. This project leverages Power BI for data visualization, Scikit-learn and TensorFlow for fraud detection, and Flask for real-time analysis.

**Objective**

•	Using Machines Learning to enhance the fraud detection
•	Implementation of ML model 
•	Training the Model on the Fraud detection dataset
•	using supervised and Unsupervised ML algorithm to get the best results
•	Using XGboost to avoid overfitting on the accuracy score
•	Implementing the trained data in Power bi for further analysis
